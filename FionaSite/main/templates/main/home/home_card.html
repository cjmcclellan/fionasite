                <dd>Hello, I'm Fiona (Ching-Hua Wang), an electrical engineer by training. Iâ€™m originally from Taiwan and came to the
                    U.S. in 2014 for my PhD program. I did my PhD at Stanford University in the Electrical Engineering department working
                    under <a href="https://nano.stanford.edu/">Philip H.-S. Wong</a>.

                    Before I came to Stanford, I worked at TSMC as a CMOS front-end integration R&D engineer. My expertise
                    is in electronic devices fabrication/characterization, non-volatile memory, CMOS process, and thin-film semiconductors devices
                </dd>
                <dd>
                I also enjoy travelling and reading (mainly non-fiction).
