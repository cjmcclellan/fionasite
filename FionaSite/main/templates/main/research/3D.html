                    The computing speed is not limited by the single device performance but the bandwidth between on chip logic and
                    off chip memory, which is called the “memory wall”. 3D stacking memory on logic would be the most efficient solution
                    for breaking this wall and 2D materials are promising for 3D stacking due to their low temperature processing. To
                    demonstrate this promise, I designed and fabricated a novel 3D monolithic memory cell, integrating MoS2 FETs and RRAM
                    for high density non-volatile memory.
