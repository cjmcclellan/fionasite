                    Black phosphorus (BP) is an air sensitive 2D material, and also one kind of thin film materials) with in theory superior
                    mobility than other 2D semiconducting material. Most research focus on p-type transistor, however, for CMOS, fabricating
                    p-type and n-type transistors on the same material is necessary. In this research, I developed a novel BP transistor
                    with Scandium as source/drain contacts and achieved a record high on-current of n-type BP FET. I had to overcome several
                    fabrication challenges, such as air sensitivity, meaning many late nights.
