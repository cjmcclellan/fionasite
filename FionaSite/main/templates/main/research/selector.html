                    In this era of data-driven applications, memory technology has become increasingly important. In order to achieve
                    high density memory array, two-terminal selectors are necessary. Two-terminal selector is an electronic device with
                    nonlinear I-V characteristic. The threshold-type selector suffers many issues such as endurance, low turn/off time,
                    cycle to cycle variation due to their ion/atom motion-based mechanism. Non-threshold type selectors are based on
                    junction band gap engineering, however, the traps in oxide limit the endurance and current drive. 2D materials are the
                    best candidates to replace oxide. In this work, I developed the first ultra-thin (â‰¤ 3 monolayer) 2D material memory
                    selector. This work is the foundation for using 2D material for high endurance non-volatile memory system.
